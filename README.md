> **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

>Project Description:
> 
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike, leading to substantial financial losses and potential security risks. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and mitigate associated risks.

> Problem Statement
> 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust fraud detection system that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves addressing several challenges, including imbalanced class distribution, data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

> Data Sources
> 
The dataset used in this project is given in the link- "https://1drv.ms/f/c/0461ab16304a887f/EjFfOxKcgqxBhO6zm1i6zwoBIotZR9-5zHZnt1CHcr7NMw" inside the double quotes. It contains transactions made by credit cards. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with a vast majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.

> Code Overview
1. Data Loading and Exploration

   • Importing necessary libraries

   •	Loading the dataset

   •	Initial exploration of the data, including descriptive statistics and class distribution

2. Data Cleaning

   •	Checking for missing values

   •	Identifying and handling outliers in transaction amounts using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method

3. Dealing with Imbalanced Data

   •	Upsampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) to balance the class distribution

4. Feature Engineering

   •	Creating new features such as 'Time_of_day' to capture daily cycles

   •	Performing a log transformation on transaction amounts to reduce skewness and scale down large values

5. Model Training and Evaluation

   •	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

   •	Training Random Forest and XGBoost models

   •	Evaluating model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports

6. Hyperparameter Tuning

   •	Fine-tuning the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters

7. Visualizing End Results

   •	Visualizing the count of predicted fraudulent transactions using a bar plot
